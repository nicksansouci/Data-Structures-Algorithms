# Data-Structures-Algorithms

This is a collection of many different data structures/algorithms I've constructed with classes and programmed functions for each using Python.

The data structures and algorithms included in this collection: Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Stack, Queue, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, 
Merge Sort, Binary Search Tree, Tree traversals, Graphs, Hash Tables, and some simple recursive functions.
